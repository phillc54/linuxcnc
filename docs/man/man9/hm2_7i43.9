.SH "NAME"
hm2_7i43 \- LinuxCNC HAL driver for the Mesa Electronics 7i43 EPP Anything IO board with HostMot2 firmware\&.

.PP
\fBioaddr\fR [default: 0 (parport0)]

The base address of the parallel port\&.
.RE
.sp
The number of ioaddr indexes/addresses given is used by the driver to determine how many boards to search for\&.
.PP
\fBioaddr_hi\fR [default: 0]
.RS 4
The secondary address of the parallel port, used to set EPP mode\&. 0 means to use ioaddr + 0x400\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBepp_wide\fR [default: 1]
.RS 4
Set to zero to disable the "wide EPP mode"\&. "Wide" mode allows a 16\- and 32\-bit EPP transfers, which can reduce the time spent in the read and write functions\&. However, this may not work on all EPP parallel ports\&.
.RE

HostMot2 config strings, described in the hostmot2(9) manpage\&.

Developer/debug use only! Enable debug logging of most EPP transfers\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
hm2_7i43 is a device driver that interfaces the Mesa 7i43 board with the HostMot2 firmware to the LinuxCNC HAL\&. Both the 200K and the 400K FPGAs are supported\&.
.sp
The driver talks with the 7i43 over the parallel port, not over USB\&. USB can be used to power the 7i43, but not to talk to it\&. USB communication with the 7i43 will not be supported any time soon, since USB has poor real\-time qualities\&.
.sp
The driver programs the board\(cqs FPGA with firmware when it registers the board with the hostmot2 driver\&. The firmware to load is specified in the \fBconfig\fR modparam, as described in the hostmot2(9) manpage, in the \fIconfig modparam\fR section\&.
.SH "JUMPER SETTINGS"
.sp
To send the FPGA configuration from the PC, the board must be configured to get its firmware from the EPP port\&. To do this, jumpers W4 and W5 must both be down, ie toward the USB connector\&.
.sp
The board must be configured to power on whether or not the USB interface is active\&. This is done by setting jumper W7 up, ie away from the edge of the board\&.
.SH "COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD"
.sp
The 7i43 communicates with the LinuxCNC computer over EPP, the Enhanced Parallel Port\&. This provides about 1 Mbps of throughput, and the communication latency is very predictable and reasonably low\&.
.sp
The parallel port must support EPP 1\&.7 or EPP 1\&.9\&. EPP 1\&.9 is preferred, but EPP 1\&.7 will work too\&. The EPP mode of the parallel port is sometimes a setting in the BIOS\&.
.sp
Note that the popular "NetMOS" aka "MosChip 9805" PCI parport cards \fBdo not work\fR\&. They do not meet the EPP spec, and cannot be reliably used with the 7i43\&. You have to find another card, sorry\&.
.sp
EPP is very reliable under normal circumstances, but bad cabling or excessively long cabling runs may cause communication timeouts\&. The driver exports a parameter named hm2_7i43\&.<BoardNum>\&.io_error to inform HAL of this condition\&. When the driver detects an EPP timeout, it sets io_error to True and stops communicating with the 7i43 board\&. Setting io_error back to False makes the driver start trying to communicate with the 7i43 again\&.
.sp
Access to the EPP bus is not threadsafe: only one realtime thread may access the EPP bus\&.
