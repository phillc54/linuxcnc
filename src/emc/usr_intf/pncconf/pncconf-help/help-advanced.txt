Advanced Options

HALUI:
    HALUI is used to communicate between EMC and a gui 
        or operator panel. 
    HALUI is always loaded.
    Click the HALUI checkbox and add your commands to 
        the text boxes
    if you choose GladeVCP options the commands will
        show.
        If you choose the  auto Z touchoff the commands 
        may need to be edited (eg for metric machines):
        G38.2 Z-2 F 16
            This is the probe command Z-2 is the maximum 
            search distance but must be inside the axis
            limits. F16 is the feed rate - it needs to be 
            slow as the tool needs to de-accelerate quickly.
        G10 L20 P0 Z.25
            This sets the Z axis origin Z.25 would be set
            at the thickness of the touchoff plate. 
        G0 Z.5
            This rapids the tool away from the plate after 
            touch off
